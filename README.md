Squid Wall (UCLA, DMA, 2010) explores the effects of human interaction on natural patterns and processes. A projected particle system reacts to motion detected in front of the wall. When all is still, the particles move freely—flocking and interacting with an underlying mathematical structure. If motion is detected, the particles form a rigid defensive stance, returning to their natural motion only when all is still again.

Many in the gallery missed the flocking patterns completely, but I don’t mind. We miss much in the world around us simply because we’re there.

Based on the behavior of reef squid and other cool creatures. Boid and flocking by [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/). Underlying structure from a flash construction by [Jared Tarbell](http://www.complexification.net/), originally inspired from work by [Martin Wattenberg](http://www.bewitched.com/).
